Why use new tech? Extend the old.

Hammer-C is literally interpreter of my own invented language that mimics OOP.
It reads classes, objects and methods and generates structs, function pointers,
and functions for each and every object defined.

Example hammer-c template:
```
@class Apple

@properties
	int weight
	@string name
@end

@methods
	void AppleEat void
@end

@objects
	McIntosh
@end

@define AppleEat
printf("Apple named %s is being eaten.\n", @this name);
```

After compilation of said code you can include generated Apple.h file in your own code.

```
#define APPLE_HAMMERC_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "Apple.h"

int main(void) {
	Apple McIntosh = AppleConstruct(10, "McIntosh");
	
	McItosh.Eat();
	McItosh.Destroy();

	return 0;
}
```
